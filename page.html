                <h2 class="pt-5 ">7. How Long We Retain Your Data For</h2>
                <p class="pb-2">When you submit a support ticket or a comment, its metadata is retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We use this data so that we can recognize you and approve your comments automatically instead of holding them for moderation. If you register on our website, we also store the personal information you provide in your user profile. You can see, edit, or delete your personal information at any time (except changing your username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.</p>
                <h2 class="pt-5">8. Security Measures</h2>
                <p>We use the SSL/HTTPS protocol throughout our site. This encrypts our user communications with the servers so that personally identifiable information is not captured/hijacked by third parties without authorization. In case of a data breach, system administrators will immediately take all needed steps to ensure system integrity, will contact affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed.</p>
                <h2 class="pt-5">9. Your Data Rights</h2>
                <h3 class="pb-2 pt-1">General Rights</h3>
                <p>If you have a registered account on this website or have left comments, you can request an exported file of the personal data we retain, including any additional data you have provided to us.</p>
                <p>You can also request that we erase any of the personal data we have stored. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase data that is vital to you being an active customer (i.e. basic account information like an email address).
                    If you wish that all of your data is erased, we will no longer be able to offer any support or other product-related services to you.</p>
                <h3>GDPR Rights</h3>
                <p class="pb-3">Your privacy is critically important to us. Going forward with the GDPR we aim to support the GDPR standard.

                    <h2 class="pt-5 pb-2">11. Release of Your Data for Legal Purposes</h2>
                    <p class="pb-3">At times it may become necessary or desirable to AxiomThemes, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.</p>
                    <p>Any passing on of personal data for legal purposes will only be done in compliance with laws of the country you reside in.</p>
